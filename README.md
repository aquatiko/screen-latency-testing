# Screen Latency Testing

**This is not an officially supported Google product**

This is an android app that uses OCR to detect text appearing in the field of
view of the camera (typically pointed at a screen or laptop display).

It attempts to provide a high accuracy as to when the text changes by:

1. Using high camera frame rates if available

2. Using synchronization to work out time differences between the phone and  the
   server controlling the test. 

The motivating use case is measuring the delay between key events and
charactersappearing on the display.  It may also be useful for additional
testing scenarios.
